Explain IAM policy evaluation logic.**                                           | - **Default = Deny** (no permission unless explicitly allowed).<br>- **Explicit Deny** always overrides everything.<br>- **Explicit Allow** grants access if no explicit deny exists.                                                                                                                             |
| **3. What are IAM policy conditions?**                                                | Conditions refine permissions using operators:<br>- **StringEquals** → Allow actions only for specific values.<br>- **IpAddress** → Restrict API calls to specific CIDRs.<br>- **DateGreaterThan** → Time-based access.<br>- **Bool** → Require MFA (`"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true`).                       |
| **4. Design a complex IAM policy for developers to manage only their own resources.** | - Use **resource tagging** with usernames.<br>- Example: Condition `StringEquals: {"aws:ResourceTag/Owner": "${aws:username}"}`.<br>- This ensures a developer can only operate on resources tagged with their own username.                                                                                      |
| **5. How would you implement cross-account access for a CI/CD pipeline?**             | - Create a **cross-account role** in target accounts with necessary permissions.<br>- CI/CD system (e.g., CodePipeline) in source account **assumes the role** using `sts:AssumeRole`.<br>- Use **External ID** for security.<br>- Temporary credentials ensure least privilege.                                  |
| **6. Explain IAM permission boundaries vs IAM policies.**                             | - **IAM Policy**: Grants or denies permissions to identity.<br>- **Permission Boundary**: Defines the *maximum* permissions identity can get. (Intersection of boundary and policies). Useful in multi-tenant or delegated admin setups.                                                                          |
| **7. How do you implement IAM policy versioning and rollback?**                       | - IAM Managed Policies support up to **5 versions**.<br>- You can set any version as the **default**.<br>- Use staging accounts/non-prod for testing before rollout.<br>- Rollback by switching default version to a previous one.                                                                                |
| **8. Design an IAM strategy for a multi-tenant SaaS application.**                    | - Use **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)** with dynamic policies.<br>- Tag resources with `TenantID`.<br>- Policy condition: `"StringEquals": {"aws:ResourceTag/TenantID": "${aws:PrincipalTag/TenantID}"}`.<br>- Ensures strict tenant isolation.<br>- Combine with **scoped-down roles** for app services. |

| **1. Explain S3 storage classes and their use cases.**                          | - **Standard** → Frequently accessed data (websites, apps).<br>- **Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)** → Data accessed less often but needs fast retrieval.<br>- **One Zone-IA** → Same as IA but stored in single AZ (cheaper, less durable).<br>- **Intelligent-Tiering** → Auto-moves data between hot/cold tiers based on usage.<br>- **Glacier** → Archival, retrieval in minutes to hours.<br>- **Glacier Deep Archive** → Long-term archival (7–10 years), cheapest, retrieval in hours. |

| **1. What is the difference between Security Groups and NACLs?**                       | - **Security Groups (SGs):** Stateful, attached to **ENIs/instances**, rules allow inbound/outbound. Return traffic is automatically allowed.<br>- **NACLs:** Stateless, applied at **subnet level**, must explicitly allow inbound/outbound. Return traffic must be separately allowed.<br>- Best practice → Use **SGs for instance-level filtering** & **NACLs for subnet-level guardrails**.                  |

| **1. What are Lambda cold starts and how to minimize them?**                             | - **Cold Start** happens when Lambda spins up a new execution environment → adds latency (100ms–several seconds).<br>- More impact in **VPC-attached Lambdas** due to ENI setup.<br>- **Minimization strategies:**<br>  - Use **Provisioned Concurrency** (keeps environments warm).<br>  - Reduce **package size** & dependencies.<br>  - Use **lighter runtimes** (Node.js, Python faster than Java/C#).<br>  - **Reuse execution context** (global connections). |
| **2. Explain Lambda execution context reuse.**                                           | - Lambda may reuse **execution environments** across invocations.<br>- Code outside the handler runs **only on first init** (good for DB connections, caching).<br>- Variables declared globally persist for future requests → improves performance.<br>- But execution reuse is **not guaranteed** (must handle fresh starts).                                                                                                                                     |

| **4. How to implement Lambda function versioning & blue-green deployments?**             | - **Versions** → Immutable copies of code/config.<br>- **Aliases** → Pointers to specific versions (e.g., `prod`, `dev`).<br>- For **blue-green/canary deployments**:<br>  - Use **weighted traffic shifting** (e.g., 10% new, 90% old).<br>  - Integrate with **CodeDeploy** for automatic rollback.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **5. Explain Lambda Layers & strategy for shared dependencies.**                         | - **Layers** → Store shared libraries/frameworks across multiple functions.<br>- Benefits → Smaller deployment packages, easier updates.<br>- Versioning supported (each new upload = new version).<br>- Best practice → Keep runtime-agnostic dependencies in layers.<br>- Limitations → Max 5 layers per function, size ≤ 250MB uncompressed.                                                                                                                     |

Design a serverless real-time data pipeline with exactly-once semantics.**          | - **Ingestion:** Kinesis / Kafka.<br>- **Processing:** Lambda with **idempotency keys**.<br>- **Storage:** DynamoDB (supports conditional writes).<br>- **Error handling:** DLQ + retries.<br>- Use **checkpointing** to ensure events processed once.<br>- Deduplication logic in Lambda to avoid double processing.                                                                                                                                               |
| **8. How to optimize Lambda performance for CPU-intensive workloads?**                   | - Allocate **more memory** → proportionally increases CPU & network.<br>- Use **multi-threading** (if supported by runtime).<br>- Keep **functions warm** with provisioned concurrency.<br>- Offload heavy compute to **ECS Fargate or Batch** if needed.<br>- Optimize code (compiled languages like Rust/Go perform better).                                                                                                                                      |

| **1. When would you use ALB vs NLB vs CLB?**                                 | - **ALB (Application Load Balancer)** → Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS), supports path-based, host-based, and header-based routing, WebSockets, and WAF integration. Best for **microservices, APIs, and modern web apps**.<br>- **NLB (Network Load Balancer)** → Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), extremely high performance (millions of req/sec), static IPs, low latency. Best for **gaming, IoT, real-time financial systems, or when you need static IP whitelisting**.<br>- **CLB (Classic Load Balancer)** → Legacy, supports Layer 4 & Layer 7 but with limited features. Only used in **legacy migrations**; AWS recommends ALB/NLB instead. |
| **2. What are ALB target groups and routing rules?**                         | - **Target Groups** = collection of EC2 instances, ECS tasks, IPs, or Lambda functions.<br>- **Routing Rules** = listener rules that decide where to send traffic:<br>   • **Path-based routing** (e.g., `/api/* → microservice A`)<br>   • **Host-based routing** (e.g., `api.example.com → API service`)<br>   • **Header/query-based routing** (advanced filtering).<br>- **Health checks** run at target group level.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Design a complex ALB config for microservices with canary deployments** | - **ALB Listener** listens on port 80/443.<br>- **Multiple Target Groups**: each microservice runs in ECS/EKS tasks.<br>- **Routing Rules**: host-based routing (`auth.example.com → Auth TG`), path-based routing (`/payments/* → Payments TG`).<br>- **Canary Deployment**: weighted routing (90% traffic → old version TG, 10% → new version TG).<br>- **Health checks** ensure only healthy targets receive traffic.<br>- Combine with **CodeDeploy** for automated blue-green deployments.                                                                                                                                |
| **4. Implement SSL termination + end-to-end encryption with ALB**            | - **SSL Termination at ALB**: attach ACM-managed SSL cert to ALB listener.<br>- **SNI (Server Name Indication)** supports multiple certs on same ALB.<br>- **End-to-End Encryption**: enable HTTPS between ALB and backend targets by installing certs on backend.<br>- **Cert Management**: use ACM for auto-renewal; rotate backend certs regularly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **5. NLB cross-zone load balancing impact**                                  | - **Without CZLB**: each NLB node only routes to targets in its AZ (risk if an AZ fails, traffic imbalance possible).<br>- **With CZLB enabled**: distributes traffic evenly across all targets in all AZs, improving resilience and balancing.<br>- **Impact**: slightly higher inter-AZ data transfer cost but **better availability + performance**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **6. Sticky sessions with ALB**                                              | - **Stickiness = session affinity**, keeps same client → same target.<br>- Achieved using **cookies**:<br>   • **Application-based cookies** (app sets the cookie, ALB respects it).<br>   • **ALB-generated duration-based cookies**.<br>- **Limitations**: not recommended for stateless services, reduces scalability. Better: use external session stores (ElastiCache, DynamoDB).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **7. Global load balancing across ALBs**                                     | - Use **Route 53 Latency-Based Routing** → directs users to nearest ALB region.<br>- Add **Route 53 Health Checks** for failover.<br>- Each region has its own ALB fronting microservices.<br>- Optionally add **CloudFront** in front for caching + DDoS protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **8. Troubleshooting ALB 5xx errors & latency**                              | - **ALB 502/503/504 errors** = bad gateway, unhealthy targets, or target timeout.<br>- Steps:<br>   • Check **ALB Access Logs** (see request path, error codes).<br>   • Use **CloudWatch Metrics** (TargetResponseTime, HTTPCode\_ELB\_5XX).<br>   • Verify **target health** and security group connectivity.<br>   • Check **connection draining** (deregistration delay).<br>- **Latency issues**: verify backend app perf, DB bottlenecks, or cross-AZ traffic.                                                                                                                                                           |

| **1. ECS EC2 launch type vs Fargate**                            | - **EC2 Launch Type**: You provision & manage EC2 instances, more control (custom AMIs, daemon sets, GPU workloads), cheaper at scale but more ops overhead.<br>- **Fargate**: Serverless containers, no infra management, pay per vCPU/memory per second. Best for microservices, event-driven workloads.                                                                  |

| **5. Task placement strategies & constraints**                   | - **Strategies**:<br>   • **Binpack** → pack tasks tightly on least used instance.<br>   • **Spread** → evenly spread across AZs/instances.<br>   • **Random** → random placement.<br>- **Constraints**: restrict by instance attributes, AZs, custom rules (e.g., only place on GPU nodes).                                                                                |
| **6. Blue-Green Deployments for ECS**                            | - Integrate **ECS + CodeDeploy**.<br>- Use **two target groups**: old (blue) and new (green).<br>- CodeDeploy shifts traffic gradually using **weighted routing**.<br>- Rollback automatically if health checks fail.<br>- Works with both **EC2 launch type & Fargate**.                                                                                                   |
| **7. ECS Batch Processing with Spot Instances**                  | - Run **ECS services or standalone tasks** on EC2 Spot Fleet (mixed instance types).<br>- Use **SQS → ECS tasks** pattern for job queueing.<br>- Implement **checkpointing** so jobs resume if Spot is interrupted.<br>- Auto-retry failed jobs via **DLQs** or Step Functions.                                                                                             |
| **8.

| **8. Disaster recovery across regions**                           | - Backup **etcd/state** with Velero.<br>- Use **multi-region clusters** (active-passive).<br>- Replicate persistent data (EBS → S3 → cross-region).<br>- Automate failover via **Route 53 health checks** + traffic routing.<br>- Stateless apps can redeploy quickly; stateful workloads need **data replication**.                   |
| **9. EKS add-ons & managing them at scale**                       | - **Managed Add-ons**: AWS-provided (VPC CNI, CoreDNS, kube-proxy, EBS CSI driver).<br>- **Custom Add-ons**: Helm charts (Prometheus, Grafana, Fluent Bit, Istio, etc.).<br>- Manage via **EKS Blueprints** or GitOps for consistency.<br>- At scale → centralize via **Cluster API** or automation frameworks (Terraform, CDK).       |

What does CloudTrail log and how is it different from CloudWatch?**              | - **CloudTrail** logs **API activity** (who did what, when, and from where) across AWS accounts.<br>- **CloudWatch** focuses on **metrics, logs, and performance monitoring**.<br>- Example: CloudTrail records “`ec2:TerminateInstances` called by IAM user X,” while CloudWatch records CPU, memory, and system logs. |
| **2. Explain event types in CloudTrail (Management, Data, Insights).**                | - **Management Events**: Control plane ops (e.g., creating EC2, IAM, S3 bucket).<br>- **Data Events**: Object-level ops (e.g., `GetObject` in S3, `PutItem` in DynamoDB).<br>- **Insights Events**: Detect **anomalous API patterns** (sudden spikes, unusual activity).                                                |
| **3. How would you design a multi-account CloudTrail strategy with central logging?** | - Enable **Organization Trail** in AWS Organizations.<br>- Deliver logs from all accounts to a **centralized S3 bucket** with **cross-account policies**.<br>- Secure with **KMS encryption + CloudWatch integration**.<br>- Apply **S3 Object Lock** for immutability (compliance).                                    |
| **4. How do you ensure CloudTrail logs are immutable and tamper-proof?**              | - Store logs in **S3 with Object Lock (WORM)**.<br>- Enable **S3 MFA Delete**.<br>- Encrypt logs with **KMS CMKs**.<br>- Restrict access using **bucket policies**.<br>- Optionally replicate to **another account/region** for DR.                                                                                     |
| **5. How do you troubleshoot missing CloudTrail events?**                             | - Verify **CloudTrail is enabled** for the region and event type.<br>- Ensure **multi-region trails** if needed.<br>- Check if **data events** are explicitly enabled.<br>- Confirm delivery to **S3 bucket/CloudWatch Logs**.<br>- Look for **service exclusions** (some services log only control plane by default).  |
| **6. How to integrate CloudTrail with SIEM/security tools?**                          | - Send logs to **CloudWatch Logs → Subscription Filter → Kinesis Stream/Firehose → SIEM (e.g., Splunk, ELK, Sentinel)**.<br>- Use **AWS Security Hub & GuardDuty** for automated threat detection.<br>- Normalize CloudTrail logs for **correlation with identity, IP, region, and API calls**.                         |
| **7. How would you detect unusual activity like root user login from an unknown IP?** | - Enable **CloudTrail Insights** + CloudWatch metric filters.<br>- Create alarms for:<br>   • `ConsoleLogin` by **Root**.<br>   • `ConsoleLogin` failures.<br>   • `IAM policy changes`.<br>- Use **SNS alerts, Security Hub integration**.<br>- Enforce MFA & **guardrail policies** (SCPs).                           |

What is AWS Config and what does it track?**                                      | - **AWS Config** is a service that tracks the **configuration of AWS resources over time**.<br>- It records **resource state changes**, **relationships**, and **compliance status**.<br>- Useful for **audit, compliance, troubleshooting, and governance**.                                                            |
| **2. What are AWS Config rules and remediation actions?**                              | - **Rules** = compliance checks (e.g., “S3 buckets must not be public”).<br>- **Managed rules** (predefined by AWS) vs **Custom rules** (Lambda-based).<br>- **Remediation**: Automatic fixes via **Systems Manager Automation Documents (SSM Docs)**.<br>- Example: Auto-remediate by **removing public S3 ACLs**.      |
| **3. How does AWS Config track resource relationships?**                               | - Config builds a **Configuration Item (CI)** for each resource.<br>- CIs include **metadata, relationships, tags, versions**.<br>- Example: An **EC2 instance** → linked to **subnet, SG, IAM role, EBS volume**.<br>- Timeline view lets you **see changes over time**.                                                |
| **4. How would you design AWS Config for enterprise compliance across 100+ accounts?** | - Enable **AWS Config Aggregators** in a **central governance account**.<br>- Use **AWS Organizations integration** for multi-account setup.<br>- Apply **Conformance Packs** (bundles of rules) for standards like **CIS, PCI-DSS, HIPAA**.<br>- Store compliance history in **central S3 bucket with Athena queries**. |
| **5. How to implement custom AWS Config rules for org-specific policies?**             | - Use **Lambda functions** to define compliance logic.<br>- Example: Ensure EC2 uses **approved instance types**.<br>- Rules can trigger on **configuration changes** or run on a **schedule**.<br>- Can include **parameters** (e.g., “allowed regions = us-east-1, eu-west-1”).                                        |
| **6. How does AWS Config support cost optimization?**                                  | - Record only **specific resource types** instead of all.<br>- Optimize **delivery channels** (aggregate to fewer accounts).<br>- Use **conformance packs** instead of individual rules.<br>- Apply **lifecycle policies** on S3 buckets storing Config history.                                                         |
| **7. How would you use Config for impact analysis and troubleshooting?**               | - Use **resource timeline** to see who/what changed.<br>- Example: EC2 went down → check if SG/role was modified.<br>- Track **tag changes** for cost & ownership visibility.<br>- Run **config queries** across resources to identify compliance gaps.                                                                  |
| **8. Difference between Config vs CloudTrail?**                                        | - **Config** = *What is the current state of a resource and how did it evolve over time?*<br>- **CloudTrail** = *Who made the API call and when?*<br>- Together: CloudTrail shows **the event** (e.g., “user modified SG”), Config shows **the before/after state** of that SG.                                          |

| **6. How to use SCPs for cost control & governance?**                                   | - Deny use of **expensive instance families** (e.g., block `p4d` unless approved).<br>- Enforce **mandatory tagging** for cost allocation.<br>- Restrict creation of resources in **non-approved regions**.<br>- Deny unnecessary services (e.g., SageMaker in non-ML OUs). |
| **7. How would you design SCPs for security compliance (encryption & access control)?** | - Enforce **S3 bucket encryption**.<br>- Deny disabling of **CloudTrail/GuardDuty**.<br>- Prevent creation of **publicly accessible resources** (S3, RDS, IAM policies).<br>- Restrict sensitive actions like `iam:PassRole` to only trusted roles.                         |
